The goddess of fortune.

A discord bot for Transneptune.

Skills
------

Dicerolling
~~~~~~~~~~~

``?roll <some dice code>``

Role assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``?role <some role>``

``?unrole <some role>``

Music
~~~~~

``?play <youtube URL>``

``?pause``

``?resume``

``?stop``

``?vol <float in [0, 2]>``

Development
-----------

Clone the repo, set up a virtualenv, install ``requirements.txt``.

You'll also need `libopus`_, which you can get on OS X easily: ``brew
install opus``.

You'll also need a Discord bot token. I leave that as an exercise to the
reader.
